# Here we demonstrate the script layer.

# This layer defines a script language which you can use anywhere an asm..end bloc can appear.
# To use the script language, just write a script..end bloc instead of an asm..end bloc.

# Script language allows the definition of global variables which are shared with the glob..end
# bloc of the symbolic asm layer. This means that the same data can be accessed by the asm and the
# script languages.
# You can refer to the grammar in file ml/layers/script/grammar for the detailed syntax.
# Here is a short list of the other script language features :
#
# - function declaration :
#	function FUNC_NAME ( ARG_LIST ) ... end
#		FUNC_NAME is a symbol.
#		ARG_LIST is a list of symbols. The last argument may be followed by `...', in which case
#		the function accepts supplemental arguments and the last argument will be set to an array
#		containing all the supplemental arguments (empty array if none).
#		Run-time checks are performed to ensure there are as many values provided as arguments defined
#		when a function is called.
#
# - function return :
#	return EXPRESSION_LIST
#		EXPRESSION_LIST is a list of expressions. It is perfectly legal to return multiple values.
#		If an expression list includes one or more calls, the returned values will be all inserted
#		in the list. This means that the expression list (x, foobar(), y) may expand to
#		(x, foo_ret1, foo_ret2, y) if foobar() returns (foo_ret1, foo_ret2).
#
# - expressions :
#	- immediate values :
#		- integers
#		- floating points
#		- strings
#
#	- arithmetic : (operators sorted by decreasing precedence)
#		-a, a/b, a*b, a-b, a+b.
#		
#	- boolean : (operators sorted by decreasing precedence)
#		not a, a and b, a or b.
#
#	- comparisons :
#		a=b, a!=b, a<b, a<=b, a>b, a>=b
#
#	- anonymous functions :
#		function (...) ... end
#
#	- call :
#		FUNC_NAME ( EXPRESSION_LIST )
#
# - instructions :
#	- print things :
#		print(...)
#	- if then else :
#		if COND then ... end
#		if COND then ... else ... end
#	- loops :
#		while COND do ... end
#	- embedded assembly :
#		asm ... end
#	- assignment :
#		VARIABLES_LIST = EXPRESSION_LIST
#		there must be as many terms in the expression list as in the variables list
#	- call :
#		FUNC_NAME ( EXPRESSION_LIST )
#		Used as an instruction, any returned values will be silently discarded.
#		Used as a boolean or arithmetic expression, exactly ONE return value is expected.
#
# - exception handling :
#	raise an exception :
#		throw SYMBOL
#	try..catch bloc :
#		try
#			...
#		catch
#			SYMBOL: ...
#			SYMBOL: ...
#		end


require "script.wc"

script
	print("Hello, world.\n")
end

# Example command and output :
#
# $ tinyaml 1.intro.script 
# Hello, world.
